# Advanced Dungeon Crawler Game

An exciting dungeon crawler game built using Python and Pygame. Navigate through procedurally generated dungeons, collect treasures, avoid traps, defeat enemies, and find the exit to escape!

---

## Features
- **Procedural Dungeon Generation**: Each dungeon is uniquely generated with rooms, corridors, and entities.
- **Dynamic Map Expansion**: The map grows as the player collects keys, increasing the challenge.
- **Entities and Interactions**:
  - **Traps**: Cause damage to the player.
  - **Treasures**: Increase the player's score.
  - **Enemies**: Chase and attack the player.
  - **Potions**: Heal the player.
  - **Keys**: Unlock expansions to the dungeon and progress toward the exit.
- **Lighting Effects**: Fog of war and player-centric lighting add immersion.
- **Particle Effects**: Visual feedback for events like taking damage.
- **Audio Support**: Background music and sound effects enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Game States**:
  - **Start Menu**: Choose to start the game or exit.
  - **Game Over**: Restart the game or quit.

## How to Play
1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. In the **Start Menu**, click **Start Game** to begin.
3. Use the following controls:
   - `W`: Move up
   - `S`: Move down
   - `A`: Move left
   - `D`: Move right
4. Collect treasures, avoid traps, defeat enemies, and find the exit.

## Development Notes
### Code Structure
- **Classes**:
  - `Player`: Handles player movement, health, inventory, and interactions.
  - `Enemy`: Implements simple enemy movement logic.
  - `Particle`: Handles particle effects for damage.
  - `DungeonGame`: Manages dungeon generation, game logic, and rendering.
  - `Camera`: Controls what portion of the dungeon is visible to the player.
- **Procedural Generation**:
  - Rooms are generated randomly and connected using corridors.
  - The dungeon expands dynamically as the player collects keys.

### Challenges
- **Performance**: Large map expansions can slow down the game. Optimization techniques like rendering only visible tiles and limiting expansions were implemented.

---

## Known Issues
- **Map Freezing**: After extensive expansions, the game may slow down or freeze due to map size and entity handling.
- **Collision Glitches**: Rare cases where entities overlap unexpectedly.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Enemy AI**: Smarter pathfinding to chase the player.
- **Additional Items**: Introduce weapons, armor, or other consumables.
- **Better Lighting**: Implement dynamic shadows for more realism.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Add cooperative or competitive gameplay.
